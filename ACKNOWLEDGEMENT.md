It gives me a great sense of pleasure to present the report of the Project Work undertaken during my B.Tech. Final Year. I owe special debt of gratitude to my Project Guide Prof Veer Bhadra Pratap Singh, School of CSIT, Symbiosis Skill and Professional University, Pune for his constant support and guidance throughout the course of my work. It is only his cognizant efforts that my endeavors have seen light of the day. My deepest thanks to my Project Coordinators Prof. Vijaykumar Bidve and Dr. Aaradhana Deshmukh at School of CSIT, Symbiosis Skill and Professional University, Pune for guiding us through the project and navigating technical challenges. 
I also do not like to miss the opportunity to acknowledge the contribution of all faculty members of the department for their kind assistance and cooperation during the development of my project. 
Last but not the least, I acknowledge my friends for their contribution in the completion of the project.
