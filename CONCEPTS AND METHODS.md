The implementation of a SOC automation project within a home lab environment. The project utilizes three key components: Wazuh, Shuffle, and TheHive, each serving distinct roles in the automation workflow.
Wazuh, an open-source security monitoring platform, is deployed as the primary agent for collecting and forwarding security-related events to the central management server, the Wazuh Manager. Shuffle acts as an intermediary, enriching alerts received from the Wazuh Manager with additional context before forwarding them to TheHive. Finally, TheHive serves as the incident response and case management tool, facilitating collaboration among SOC analysts and orchestrating response actions based on enriched alerts.
The home lab environment consists of a Windows PC hosting the Wazuh Agent, a cloud-based server housing the Wazuh Manager, Shuffle, and TheHive instances, and a network infrastructure to facilitate communication between these components.
