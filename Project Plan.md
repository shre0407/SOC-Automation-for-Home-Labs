# SOC Automation Project Workflow

The SOC automation project follows a well-defined workflow, seamlessly orchestrating the activities of the various components involved. This workflow ensures that security events are efficiently processed, analyzed, and acted upon, providing a robust defense against potential threats. The workflow can be summarized as follows:

## 1. Event Generation

Security events and logs are generated by the **Wazuh Agent** installed on the local Windows 10 VM. This agent captures a wide range of activities and anomalies within the host system, including system logs, network traffic, and other security-relevant data. The Wazuh Agent continuously monitors the system and forwards the collected data to the **Wazuh Manager** for further processing.

## 2. Event Processing

The **Wazuh Manager**, residing in the cloud environment, receives the security events forwarded by the Wazuh Agent. It processes and analyzes these events, correlating them to identify potential security incidents. The Wazuh Manager uses predefined rules and policies to detect anomalies and potential threats within the collected data.

## 3. Alert Generation

Relevant alerts based on predefined rules and policies are generated by the **Wazuh Manager**. These alerts indicate potential security threats or anomalies detected within the environment. The alerts are designed to provide actionable information to the SOC team, highlighting the nature and severity of the detected issues.

## 4. Alert Enrichment

Alerts are forwarded from the **Wazuh Manager** to **Shuffle**, where they undergo enrichment with additional context. This process involves incorporating Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) and other relevant information to enhance the relevance and actionable insights of the alerts. Shuffle integrates with various external data sources and APIs to gather the necessary context, making the alerts more informative for SOC analysts.

## 5. Alert Analysis

Enriched alerts are then dispatched from **Shuffle** to **TheHive** for in-depth analysis by SOC analysts. Analysts assess the severity and impact of the alerts, determining appropriate response actions. TheHive provides a centralized platform for managing incidents, tracking progress, and coordinating response efforts, ensuring that all relevant information is easily accessible and organized.

## 6. Response Orchestration

TheHive triggers email notifications to SOC analysts, presenting the enriched alerts and soliciting their input for further action. Analysts interact via email, providing instructions and decisions regarding response actions. This step ensures that the SOC team remains informed and can quickly respond to potential threats.

## 7. Mitigation Efforts

Based on the decisions of SOC analysts, **TheHive** communicates response actions back to **Shuffle**, which relays them to the **Wazuh Manager**. The Wazuh Manager then triggers responsive actions carried out by the **Wazuh Agent** on the Windows 10 PC. These actions are designed to mitigate or address the detected security threats effectively, ensuring that the system remains secure.

This workflow demonstrates the seamless integration and automation of security operations, enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of SOC activities. By leveraging the capabilities of Wazuh, Shuffle, and TheHive, this project provides a robust framework for detecting, analyzing, and mitigating potential security incidents.
