The SOC automation project follows a well-defined workflow, seamlessly orchestrating the activities of the various components involved. The workflow can be summarized as follows:
1. Event Generation:
Security events and logs are generated by the Wazuh Agent installed on the local Windows 10 VM, capturing activities and anomalies within the host system.
2. Event Processing:
The Wazuh Manager, residing in the cloud environment, receives, processes, and analyzes the security events forwarded by the Wazuh Agent, correlating them to identify potential security incidents.
3. Alert Generation:
Relevant alerts based on predefined rules and policies are generated by the Wazuh Manager, indicating potential security threats or anomalies detected within the environment.
4. Alert Enrichment:
Alerts are forwarded from the Wazuh Manager to Shuffle, where they undergo enrichment with additional context, incorporating Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) and other relevant information to enhance their relevance and actionable insights.
5. Alert Analysis:
Enriched alerts are then dispatched from Shuffle to TheHive for in-depth analysis by SOC analysts, who assess the severity and impact of the alerts and determine appropriate response actions.
6. Response Orchestration:
TheHive triggers email notifications to SOC analysts, presenting the enriched alerts and soliciting their input for further action. Analysts interact via email, providing instructions and decisions regarding response actions.

7. Mitigation Efforts:
Based on the decisions of SOC analysts, TheHive communicates response actions back to Shuffle, which relays them to the Wazuh Manager. The Wazuh Manager then triggers responsive actions carried out by the Wazuh Agent on the Windows 10 PC, mitigating or addressing the detected security threats effectively.
